# Pokemon-Team-Suggestion-Generator
This is a generator to help Pokemon Video Game Championship series players to figure out team ideas
This is a tool to help Pokemon Video Game Championship series players to figure out ideas of teams they can create in Gen IV. This generator will have you pick one of the three starter Pokemon from Gen IV then will suggest a possible team centered around the starter Pokemon you chose. This tool uses Decision Tree machine learning methods to choose Pokemon fit to be on a team for the chosen starter Pokemon. For this code to work, you will need to have the excel sheets that contain the data for this bot to learn from. The excel sheets also have the Pokemon weakness/strength type chart so the bot can consider the starter Pokemon's type in its decisions. The generator can create a plethera of options for possible teams a Pokemon VGC player can build to compete with.
